# Modelling-Mass-of-Toxins-in-the-Great-Lakes-Systems
This is a Mathematical Modelling projects I had worked on with 2 other UBC students for a course. In this project, we created a deterministic model in Python which describes the change in mass of toxins in each of the Five Great Lakes as a function of time. I had worked on this project separately on my own which improves the model.
